        <h2><u>Synopsis</u></h2>
        <p>Yearning to make friends and perform live with a band, lonely and socially anxious Hitori "Bocchi" Gotou devotes her time to playing the guitar. On a fateful day, Bocchi meets the outgoing drummer Nijika Ijichi, who invites her to join Kessoku Band when their guitarist, Ikuyo Kita, flees before their first show. Soon after, Bocchi meets her final bandmate, the cool bassist Ryou Yamada.</p>
        <p>Although their first performance together is subpar, the girls feel empowered by their shared love for music, and they are soon rejoined by Kita. Finding happiness in performing, Bocchi and her bandmates put their hearts into improving as musicians while making the most of their fleeting high school days.</p>

        
        <h2><u>Produce</u></h2>
        <p>The reason for starting this animation project is that Kerorira, who is the character designer and chief animation director, is a big fan of the original manga work. Kerorira has been looking for animation information for a long time that if this work is to be animated, she herself wants to be involved. Around June 2019, when Kerorira was out with CloverWorks producer Shota Umehara in private, they were talking about an animation project for the same work. Coincidentally, its parent company, Aniplex, came to CloverWorks for a project, so Umehara's team took production and started the animation project.</p>

        <p>The reason why Keiichiro Saito was appointed as director was because of Kerorira's desire to "make a joint work". Umehara, who has a connection with other works and knows what they are capable of, participates in the form of an exclamation. Another group was formed by producer Umehara taking into account the suitability of each staff member and schedule. Umehara had experience participating in Kirara's works at Doga Kobo, his former studio, and participating staff included Yoshiyuki Fujiwara, director of NEW GAME!, staff working for the company as well. Additionally, Jun Yamazaki, character designer for Three Leaves, Three Colors, and Yukiko Horiguchi, character designer for K-ON!, participated in the unlock animation.</p>
            
        <p>The appointment of Erika Yoshida, series composition and screenwriter, was proposed by Aniplex. Introduced in the margins of Love Me, Love Me Not, Saito also went along because he wanted to use it after seeing the manuscript of his previous work. Yoshida is in charge of the scripts of all episodes.</p>
